# Visualising CSS colours with React and D3

A program that loads in CSS colours csv file using D3 utilities - namely pie and arc libraries, and uses React state to visualise the data.

Small project following along with `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LhoCfjm8R4`, using Create React App template and NPM instead of UMD as described in videos.

Taken from MDN CSS colours: `https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#color-syntax` and cleaned up using google sheets before saving to project as simple csv file and creating  git gist link.
